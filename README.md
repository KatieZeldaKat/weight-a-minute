# Weight a Minute

Designed specifically for powerlifting, this app tracks the sets you've completed. After marking a set as completed, a timer will start, indicating how much time you should rest before starting your next set.

## Background

I created this app as an all-in-one means to track workouts. Previously, I'd have a notes app with a checklist of sets I completed, along with my clock app where I could set one-minute timers. Having two apps has on more than one occasion meant I've either forgotten to start a timer, or more frequently, forget to mark a set as completed. By linking the two together, there's no question as to whether I'm on set two or three - I simply go by what the app says.
